Yuito is fork of [Tusky](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky).

Tusky is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). Mastodon is an ActivityPub federated social network. That means no single entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.

## Features

- Material Design
- Most Mastodon APIs implemented
- Multi-Account support
- Dark, light and black themes with the possibility to auto-switch based on the time of day
- Drafts - compose posts and save them for later
- Choose between different emoji styles
- Optimized for all screen sizes
- Completely open-source - no non-free dependencies like Google services

### Support

If you have any bug reports, feature requests or questions please open an issue or send us a message at [@ars42525@odakyu.app](https://odakyu.app/@ars42525)!
